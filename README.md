# üè† Welcome!

The Discourse Graph extension enables [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) users to seamlessly add additional semantic structure to their notes, including specified page types and link types that [model scientific discourse](fundamentals/what-is-a-discourse-graph.md), to enable more complex and structured [knowledge synthesis work](https://oasislab.pubpub.org/pub/54t0y9mk/release/3), such as a complex interdisciplinary literature review, and enhanced collaboration with others on this work.

## Overview

Here is a relatively brief walkthrough of some of the main features of the extension, including creating discourse nodes and relations, and [using](guides/exploring-your-discourse-graph/), [querying](guides/querying-your-discourse-graph.md), and [sharing](guides/sharing-your-discourse-graph.md) the discourse graph. This is done in the context of an actual ongoing literature review.
