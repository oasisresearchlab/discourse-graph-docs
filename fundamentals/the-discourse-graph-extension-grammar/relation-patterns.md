# Relation patterns

## Stock patterns

### Evidence informs question

This basically says, if you reference an evidence page in a question page, then the evidence `informs` the question, and the question is `informed by` the evidence.

### Evidence supports claim

This basically says, if you indent an evidence page underneath a block that references the "SupportedBy" page, and indent that under a block that has a claim in it, then the evidence `supports` the claim, and the claim is `supported by` the evidence.

### Evidence opposes claim

This is very similar to the "Evidence Supports Claim" relation pattern, with the exception that the "linking block" references an "OpposedBy" page instead of a "SupportedBy" page.&#x20;
