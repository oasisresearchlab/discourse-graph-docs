# Querying your discourse graph

{% hint style="info" %}
**More detailed instructions coming soon!**
{% endhint %}

The query drawer component allows you to construct structured queries over your discourse graph, based on discourse relations (e.g., "find all evidence that supports/opposes a claim"), and reason over the results in a structured, tabular format (e.g., "find all evidence that supports a claim, and allow me to filter/sort by methodological details").&#x20;

Use Command Palette (âŒ˜+`P` on Mac,`CTRL`+ `P` otherwise) to access the query drawer.
