# Sharing your discourse graph

You can export your discourse graph as a whole, or from queries of your graph, to archive your most important notes, or share them with others.

The extension exports to 1) markdown, 2) csv (neo4j-compatible [labeled property graph](https://neo4j.com/blog/rdf-triple-store-vs-labeled-property-graph-difference/)), and 3) `json`
