# Node index

The extension has node pages for each node you define, which provides a query over all of your nodes of that type. For example, you can go to the `discourse-graph/Nodes/Question` page to see all the question nodes in your graph.

This can be quite handy in multiplayer settings, for example, to quickly view the latest question nodes that have been added to the graph, or who authored them, by modifying the default index query, just like a [regular query](../querying-your-discourse-graph.md).
