# Discourse context

The discourse context component adds a "higher-signal" linked references section to each discourse node, that allows you to explore _discourse_ relations (e.g., inform, support, etc.) between this node and other nodes in your discourse graph.

Things you can do:

### Group by target node

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/d-context group by.gif>)

### Filter results

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/filter results.gif>)
